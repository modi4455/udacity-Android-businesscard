Single Screen App
An Android single screen app project to conclude the Android Basics: User Interface from UDACITY Android-Basics path.

Project Overview
To test your skills from this free course, design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.
